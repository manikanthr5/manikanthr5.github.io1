Hello there,

Thanks for taking time to know more about me. My name is Manikanth Reddy (you can call me Manikanth or Mani).

I currently work as an Analyst (Machine Learning) at American Express. I am a part of Machine Learning and Data Science team based out of Bangalore, India. As part of the team, I work on solving a broad range of problems related to Credit and Fraud Risk. 

My latest project is on **Bank Statement Summarization** using **Natural Language Processing**. 
- I helped reduce the response time of the ML Project by 3 fold using Code Optimization and Caching techniques which led to satisfying SLA time requirements for the first version of the model.
- I am currently responsible on building models for International markets and Unified model for all languages.
- **I have been working on this project for last 3 months and due to project restrictions I can't discolse any more details.**
- I am sure that this is one of the best projects I have worked on till now. I got the chance to enchance my technical and business skills:
  - **Technical Skills** - Being my first big NLP project, I got good pratical experience from basic embeddings to using latest SOTA techniques in Natural Language Processing. Understood how to use productionize models using Docker. Working on the production code base with colleagues.
  - **Business skills** - First time working on a project which involved more than 50 colleagues working on the same project. Got good understanding of how to present to various stakeholders with varying bussiness and technical skills (From VPs to Analysis) as well as large audiences. 

As part of the Machine Learning and Data Science team, I have also worked on:
- Creating a loss function to solve multiple business objectives (Capture rate and Dollar Savings of Credit and Fraud Models) at the same time.
- Upgrading RNN Suite - A package used across American Express modelling teams to build Time Series based Machine Learning models for various usecases.  
- Revenue forecasting of companies using XGBoost on sparse data. 
- Some other research projects I have worked on include Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations), Adverserial Attacks on Machine Learning Models for Fraud Detection (lasted only for few days), Knowledge Distillation, Attention based Neural Networks.

- Also as part of the Machine Learning and Data Science team I have presented on the 3 research learning sessions to the Bangalore Decision Science teams:
  - PyTorch Training (From Basic to Advanced)
  - Top Research Topics from MLDS 2020 Bangalore Conference
  - Knowledge Distillation

I have received **SVP Star Acheivement Award for Q4 2019** (Decision Science & Data Strategy Team) and I believe that I am one of the youngest to the receive this award...

I recevied my Bachelors Degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. My major is on Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. I was ranked 3rd among Bachelor Degree students in my department.
- I have participated in various Hackations:
  - I got 2nd place in Data Science Hackathon conducted by HSBC (5 man team) and was invited to HSBC Data & Analtyics Symposium 2019 held at Kolkata.
  - I was placed in Top 10 teams of AnalyzeThis 2018 competition held by American Express and received a PPI (Pre-Placement Interview Offer) for the same. I was converted this offer into full time and Joined American Express in July 2019 as a part of Machine Learning and Data Science Team. (2 man team).
  - I participated in Code.Fun.Do 2015 competition held by Microsoft and built an app within 2 days in C# (3 man team).
- I learnt Programming and Data Science skills from Coursework and MOOCs.
- Some Relevant Coursework Include: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Theory and Lab), Programming Data Structures, Artificial Intellience, Soft Computing Tools (Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic and Evolutionary Algorithms), Probability and Stochastic Processes, Computer Applications in Metallurgical Processes.
- Some MOOCs I have took include: Machine Learning, Applied Data Science in Python, Deep Learning, TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research, Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing.
- I was the Web Development Lead for [COMPOSIT](http://www1.iitkgp.ac.in/downloads/composit.htm). I lead a team of 5 people to build the Website for the 25th edition of the conference (2017-18).
- As a Dakshana Alumni (DAAN Alum, an NGO), I have volunteered to organize Grand Dakshana Selection Test for 3 years. I was also the college representative for 2016-17 sesion.

I completed by 12th Standard from [Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Gachibowli](https://www.navodaya.gov.in/nvs/nvs-school/RANGAREDDY/hi/contact-us/JNV/) as a [Dakshana Scholar](https://dakshana.org/). I become a Dakshana Scholar after clearing the [Grand Daskhana Selection Test 2013](https://dakshana.org/become-a-scholar/). Dakshana is an NGO registered in India.
- I cleared KVPY Scholar exam under Stream-SX.
- I completed by 10th Standard from [Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Anantapur](https://navodaya.gov.in/nvs/nvs-school/Ananthapuram/en/contact-us/JNV/).

In my free time, I work on [Kaggle]({{ site.kaggleurl }}) or read manga (can talk days about One Piece and Haikyuu, if you are into it). I also play Table Tennis, Cricket, Badminton and Volley Ball. I also developed building Video Games (Mainly in Unity) as a hobby.
