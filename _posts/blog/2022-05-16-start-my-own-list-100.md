I have been thinking about starting a list of 100 things I want to do before I die after going through <a href="https://huyenchip.com/list-100/" target="_blank">Chip Huyen's List 100</a>. Lately it's become more monetonous working from home. So I am thinking that having a list of 100 things to do would keep me looking forward to the next day. You can go through my [100 Things to do before I die here](http://localhost:4000/list-100).
